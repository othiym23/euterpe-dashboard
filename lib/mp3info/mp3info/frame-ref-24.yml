AENC:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: audio encryption
  long: >-
    This frame indicates if the actual audio stream is encrypted, and by
    whom. Since standardisation of such encryption scheme is beyond this
    document, all "AENC" frames begin with a terminated string with a
    URL containing an email address, or a link to a location where an
    email address can be found, that belongs to the organisation
    responsible for this specific encrypted audio file. Questions
    regarding the encrypted audio should be sent to the email address
    specified.

APIC:
  status: COMPLETE
  terse: attached picture
  long: >-
    This frame contains a picture directly related to the audio file.
    Image format is the MIME type and subtype [MIME] for the image. In
    the event that the MIME media type name is omitted, "image/" will be
    implied. The "image/png" [PNG] or "image/jpeg" [JFIF] picture format
    should be used when interoperability is wanted. Description is a
    short description of the picture, represented as a terminated
    text string. There may be several pictures attached to one file, each
    in their individual "APIC" frame, but only one with the same content
    descriptor. There may only be one picture with the picture type
    declared as picture type $01 and $02 respectively. There is the
    possibility to put only a link to the image file by using the 'MIME
    type' "-->" and having a complete URL [URL] instead of picture data.
    The use of linked files should however be used sparingly since there
    is the risk of separation of files.

ASPI:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: audio seek point index
  long: >-
    Audio files with variable bit rates are intrinsically difficult to
    deal with in the case of seeking within the file. The ASPI frame
    makes seeking easier by providing a list a seek points within the
    audio file. The seek points are a fractional offset within the audio
    data, providing a starting point from which to find an appropriate
    point to start decoding. The presence of an ASPI frame requires the
    existence of a TLEN frame, indicating the duration of the file in
    milliseconds. There may only be one 'audio seek point index' frame in
    a tag.

COMM:
  status: COMPLETE
  terse: comments
  long: >-
    This frame is intended for any kind of full text information that
    does not fit in any other frame. It consists of a frame header
    followed by encoding, language and content descriptors and is ended
    with the actual comment as a text string. Newline characters are
    allowed in the comment text string. There may be more than one
    comment frame in each tag, but only one with the same language and
    content descriptor.

COMR:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: commercial frame
  long: |-
    This frame enables several competing offers in the same tag by
       bundling all needed information. That makes this frame rather complex
       but it's an easier solution than if one tries to achieve the same
       result with several frames. The frame begins, after the frame ID,
       size and encoding fields, with a price string field. A price is
       constructed by one three character currency code, encoded according
       to ISO 4217 [ISO-4217] alphabetic currency code, followed by a
       numerical value where "." is used as decimal separator. In the price
       string several prices may be concatenated, separated by a "/"
       character, but there may only be one currency of each type.
       The price string is followed by an 8 character date string in the
       format YYYYMMDD, describing for how long the price is valid. After
       that is a contact URL, with which the user can contact the seller,
       followed by a one byte 'received as' field. It describes how the
       audio is delivered when bought according to the following list:
            $00: Other,
            $01: Standard CD album with other songs,
            $02: Compressed audio on CD,
            $03: File over the Internet,
            $04: Stream over the Internet,
            $05: As note sheets,
            $06: As note sheets in a book with other sheets,
            $07: Music on other media,
            $08: Non-musical merchandise.
       Next follows a terminated string with the name of the seller followed
       by a terminated string with a short description of the product. The
       last thing is the ability to include a company logotype. The first of
       them is the 'Picture MIME type' field containing information about
       which picture format is used. In the event that the MIME media type
       name is omitted, "image/" will be implied. Currently only "image/png"
       and "image/jpeg" are allowed. This format string is followed by the
       binary picture data. This two last fields may be omitted if no
       picture is attached. There may be more than one 'commercial frame' in
       a tag, but no two may be identical.

ENCR:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: encryption method registration
  long: >-
    To identify with which method a frame has been encrypted the
    encryption method must be registered in the tag with this frame. The
    'Owner identifier' is a null-terminated string with a URL [URL]
    containing an email address, or a link to a location where an email
    address can be found, that belongs to the organisation responsible
    for this specific encryption method. Questions regarding the
    encryption method should be sent to the indicated email address. The
    'Method symbol' contains a value that is associated with this method
    throughout the whole tag, in the range $80-F0. All other values are
    reserved. The 'Method symbol' may optionally be followed by
    encryption specific data. There may be several "ENCR" frames in a tag
    but only one containing the same symbol and only one containing the
    same owner identifier. The method must be used somewhere in the tag.

EQU2:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: equalisation (2)
  long: >-
    This is another subjective, alignment frame. It allows the user to
    predefine an equalisation curve within the audio file. There may be
    more than one "EQU2" frame in each tag, but only one with the same
    identification string.

ETCO:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: event timing codes
  long: >-
    This frame allows synchronisation with key events in the audio.

GEOB:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: general encapsulated object
  long: >-
    In this frame any type of file can be encapsulated. After the header,
    'Frame size' and 'Encoding' follows 'MIME type' [MIME] represented as
    as a terminated string encoded with ISO 8859-1 [ISO-8859-1]. The
    filename is case sensitive and is encoded as 'Encoding'. Then follows
    a content description as terminated string, encoded as 'Encoding'.
    The last thing in the frame is the actual object. The first two
    strings may be omitted, leaving only their terminations. MIME type is
    always an ISO-8859-1 text string. There may be more than one "GEOB"
    frame in each tag, but only one with the same content descriptor.

GRID:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: group identification registration
  long: >-
    This frame enables grouping of otherwise unrelated frames. This can
    be used when some frames are to be signed. To identify which frames
    belongs to a set of frames a group identifier must be registered in
    the tag with this frame. The 'Owner identifier' is a null-terminated
    string with a URL [URL] containing an email address, or a link to a
    location where an email address can be found, that belongs to the
    organisation responsible for this grouping. Questions regarding the
    grouping should be sent to the indicated email address. The 'Group
    symbol' contains a value that associates the frame with this group
    throughout the whole tag, in the range $80-F0. All other values are
    reserved. The 'Group symbol' may optionally be followed by some group
    specific data, e.g. a digital signature. There may be several "GRID"
    frames in a tag but only one containing the same symbol and only one
    containing the same owner identifier. The group symbol must be used
    somewhere in the tag.

LINK:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: linked information
  long: >-
    To keep information duplication as low as possible this frame may be
    used to link information from another ID3v2 tag that might reside in
    another audio file or alone in a binary file. It is RECOMMENDED that
    this method is only used when the files are stored on a CD-ROM or
    other circumstances when the risk of file separation is low. The
    frame contains a frame identifier, which is the frame that should be
    linked into this tag, a URL [URL] field, where a reference to the
    file where the frame is given, and additional ID data, if needed.
    Data should be retrieved from the first tag found in the file to
    which this link points. There may be more than one "LINK" frame in a
    tag, but only one with the same contents. A linked frame is to be
    considered as part of the tag and has the same restrictions as if it
    was a physical part of the tag (i.e. only one "RVRB" frame allowed,
    whether it's linked or not).

MCDI:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: music CD identifier
  long: >-
    This frame is intended for music that comes from a CD, so that the CD
    can be identified in databases such as the CDDB [CDDB]. The frame
    consists of a binary dump of the Table Of Contents, TOC, from the CD,
    which is a header of 4 bytes and then 8 bytes/track on the CD plus 8
    bytes for the 'lead out', making a maximum of 804 bytes. The offset
    to the beginning of every track on the CD should be described with a
    four bytes absolute CD-frame address per track, and not with absolute
    time. When this frame is used the presence of a valid "TRCK" frame is
    REQUIRED, even if the CD's only got one track. It is recommended that
    this frame is always added to tags originating from CDs. There may
    only be one "MCDI" frame in each tag.

MLLT:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: MPEG location lookup table
  long: >-
    To increase performance and accuracy of jumps within a MPEG [MPEG]
    audio file, frames with time codes in different locations in the file
    might be useful. This ID3v2 frame includes references that the
    software can use to calculate positions in the file. After the frame
    header follows a descriptor of how much the 'frame counter' should be
    increased for every reference. If this value is two then the first
    reference points out the second frame, the 2nd reference the 4th
    frame, the 3rd reference the 6th frame etc. In a similar way the
    'bytes between reference' and 'milliseconds between reference' points
    out bytes and milliseconds respectively.
    Each reference consists of two parts; a certain number of bits, as
    defined in 'bits for bytes deviation', that describes the difference
    between what is said in 'bytes between reference' and the reality and
    a certain number of bits, as defined in 'bits for milliseconds
    deviation', that describes the difference between what is said in
    'milliseconds between reference' and the reality. The number of bits
    in every reference, i.e. 'bits for bytes deviation'+'bits for
    milliseconds deviation', must be a multiple of four. There may only
    be one "MLLT" frame in each tag.

OWNE:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: ownership frame
  long: >-
    The ownership frame might be used as a reminder of a made transaction
    or, if signed, as proof. Note that the "USER" and "TOWN" frames are
    good to use in conjunction with this one. The frame begins, after the
    frame ID, size and encoding fields, with a 'price paid' field. The
    first three characters of this field contains the currency used for
    the transaction, encoded according to ISO 4217 [ISO-4217] alphabetic
    currency code. Concatenated to this is the actual price paid, as a
    numerical string using "." as the decimal separator. Next is an 8
    character date string (YYYYMMDD) followed by a string with the name
    of the seller as the last field in the frame. There may only be one
    "OWNE" frame in a tag.

PRIV:
  status: COMPLETE
  terse: private frame
  long: >-
    This frame is used to contain information from a software producer
    that its program uses and does not fit into the other frames. The
    frame consists of an 'Owner identifier' string and the binary data.
    The 'Owner identifier' is a null-terminated string with a URL [URL]
    containing an email address, or a link to a location where an email
    address can be found, that belongs to the organisation responsible
    for the frame. Questions regarding the frame should be sent to the
    indicated email address. The tag may contain more than one "PRIV"
    frame but only with different contents.

PCNT:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: play counter
  long: >-
    This is simply a counter of the number of times a file has been
    played. The value is increased by one every time the file begins to
    play. There may only be one "PCNT" frame in each tag. When the
    counter reaches all one's, one byte is inserted in front of the
    counter thus making the counter eight bits bigger.  The counter must
    be at least 32-bits long to begin with.

POPM:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: popularimeter
  long: >-
    The purpose of this frame is to specify how good an audio file is.
    Many interesting applications could be found to this frame such as a
    playlist that features better audio files more often than others or
    it could be used to profile a person's taste and find other 'good'
    files by comparing people's profiles. The frame contains the email
    address to the user, one rating byte and a four byte play counter,
    intended to be increased with one for every time the file is played.
    The email is a terminated string. The rating is 1-255 where 1 is
    worst and 255 is best. 0 is unknown. If no personal counter is wanted
    it may be omitted. When the counter reaches all one's, one byte is
    inserted in front of the counter thus making the counter eight bits
    bigger in the same away as the play counter ("PCNT"). There may be
    more than one "POPM" frame in each tag, but only one with the same
    email address.

POSS:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: position synchronisation frame
  long: >-
    This frame delivers information to the listener of how far into the
    audio stream he picked up; in effect, it states the time offset from
    the first frame in the stream. There may only be one "POSS" frame in
    each tag.

RBUF:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: recommended buffer size
  long: >-
    Sometimes the server from which an audio file is streamed is aware of
    transmission or coding problems resulting in interruptions in the
    audio stream. In these cases, the size of the buffer can be
    recommended by the server using this frame. If the 'embedded info
    flag' is true (1) then this indicates that an ID3 tag with the
    maximum size described in 'Buffer size' may occur in the audio
    stream. In such case the tag should reside between two MPEG [MPEG]
    frames, if the audio is MPEG encoded. If the position of the next tag
    is known, 'offset to next tag' may be used. The offset is calculated
    from the end of tag in which this frame resides to the first byte of
    the header in the next. This field may be omitted. Embedded tags are
    generally not recommended since this could render unpredictable
    behaviour from present software/hardware.
    For applications like streaming audio it might be an idea to embed
    tags into the audio stream though. If the clients connects to
    individual connections like HTTP and there is a possibility to begin
    every transmission with a tag, then this tag should include a
    'recommended buffer size' frame. If the client is connected to a
    arbitrary point in the stream, such as radio or multicast, then the
    'recommended buffer size' frame SHOULD be included in every tag.
    The 'Buffer size' should be kept to a minimum. There may only be one
    "RBUF" frame in each tag.

RVA2:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: relative volume adjustment (2)
  long: >-
    This is a more subjective frame than the previous ones. It allows the
    user to say how much he wants to increase/decrease the volume on each
    channel when the file is played. The purpose is to be able to align
    all files to a reference volume, so that you don't have to change the
    volume constantly. This frame may also be used to balance adjust the
    audio. The volume adjustment is encoded as a fixed point decibel
    value, 16 bit signed integer representing (adjustment*512), giving
    +/- 64 dB with a precision of 0.001953125 dB. E.g. +2 dB is stored as
    $04 00 and -2 dB is $FC 00. There may be more than one "RVA2" frame
    in each tag, but only one with the same identification string.

RVRB:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: reverb
  long: >-
    Yet another subjective frame, with which you can adjust echoes of
    different kinds. Reverb left/right is the delay between every bounce
    in ms. Reverb bounces left/right is the number of bounces that should
    be made. $FF equals an infinite number of bounces. Feedback is the
    amount of volume that should be returned to the next echo bounce. $00
    is 0%, $FF is 100%. If this value were $7F, there would be 50% volume
    reduction on the first bounce, 50% of that on the second and so on.
    Left to left means the sound from the left bounce to be played in the
    left speaker, while left to right means sound from the left bounce to
    be played in the right speaker. There may only be one "RVRB" frame in
    each tag.

SEEK:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: seek frame
  long: >-
    This frame indicates where other tags in a file/stream can be found.
    The 'minimum offset to next tag' is calculated from the end of this
    tag to the beginning of the next. There may only be one 'seek frame'
    in a tag.

SIGN:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: signature frame
  long: >-
    This frame enables a group of frames, grouped with the 'Group
    identification registration', to be signed. Although signatures can
    reside inside the registration frame, it might be desired to store
    the signature elsewhere, e.g. in watermarks. There may be more than
    one 'signature frame' in a tag, but no two may be identical.

SYLT:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: synchronised lyric / text
  long: >-
    This is another way of incorporating the words, said or sung lyrics,
    in the audio file as text, this time, however, in sync with the
    audio. It might also be used to describing events e.g. occurring on a
    stage or on the screen in sync with the audio. The header includes a
    content descriptor, represented with as terminated text string. If no
    descriptor is entered, 'Content descriptor' is $00 (00) only.
    There may be more than one "SYLT" frame in each tag, but only one
    with the same language and content descriptor.

SYTC:
  status: UNIMPLEMENTED
  terse: synchronised tempo codes
  long: >-
    For a more accurate description of the tempo of a musical piece, this
    frame might be used. After the header follows one byte describing
    which time stamp format should be used. Then follows one or more
    tempo codes. Each tempo code consists of one tempo part and one time
    part. The tempo is in BPM described with one or two bytes. If the
    first byte has the value $FF, one more byte follows, which is added
    to the first giving a range from 2 - 510 BPM, since $00 and $01 is
    reserved. $00 is used to describe a beat-free time period, which is
    not the same as a music-free time period. $01 is used to indicate one
    single beat-stroke followed by a beat-free period.
    The tempo descriptor is followed by a time stamp. Every time the
    tempo in the music changes, a tempo descriptor may indicate this for
    the player. All tempo descriptors MUST be sorted in chronological
    order. The first beat-stroke in a time-period is at the same time as
    the beat description occurs. There may only be one "SYTC" frame in
    each tag.

TALB:
  status: DEFAULT
  terse: album / movie / show title
  long: >-
    The 'Album/Movie/Show title' frame is intended for the title of the
    recording (or source of sound) from which the audio in the file is
    taken.

TBPM:
  status: DEFAULT
  terse: BPM (beats per minute)
  long: >-
    The 'BPM' frame contains the number of beats per minute in the
    main part of the audio. The BPM is an integer and represented as a
    numerical string.

TCMP:
  status: COMPLETE
  terse: compilation flag (NONSTANDARD)
  long: >-
    Whether the track is from a compilation release, with '1' being true
    and '0' being false. WARNING: This frame is a non-standard extension
    created by Apple for use in its iTunes software. No other software is
    guaranteed to recognize it or preserve it.

TCOM:
  status: DEFAULT
  terse: composer
  long: >-
    The 'Composer' frame is intended for the name of the composer.

TCON:
  status: COMPLETE
  terse: content type
  long: >-
    The 'Content type', which ID3v1 was stored as a one byte numeric
    value only, is now a string. You may use one or several of the ID3v1
    types as numerical strings, or, since the category list would be
    impossible to maintain with accurate and up to date categories,
    define your own. Example: "21" $00 "Eurodisco" $00
    You may also use any of the following keywords RX for remixes and CR
    for cover versions.

TCOP:
  status: DEFAULT
  terse: copyright message
  long: >-
    The 'Copyright message' frame, in which the string must begin with a
    year and a space character (making five characters), is intended for
    the copyright holder of the original sound, not the audio file
    itself. The absence of this frame means only that the copyright
    information is unavailable or has been removed, and must not be
    interpreted to mean that the audio is public domain. Every time this
    field is displayed the field must be preceded with "Copyright Â©",
    where (C) is one character showing a C in a circle.

TDEN:
  status: DEFAULT
  terse: encoding time
  long: >-
    The 'Encoding time' frame contains a timestamp describing when the
    audio was encoded.

TDLY:
  status: DEFAULT
  terse: playlist delay
  long: >-
    The 'Playlist delay' defines the numbers of milliseconds of silence
    that should be inserted before this audio. The value zero indicates
    that this is a part of a multifile audio track that should be played
    continuously.

TDOR:
  status: DEFAULT
  terse: original release time
  long: >-
    The 'Original release time' frame contains a timestamp describing
    when the original recording of the audio was released.

TDRC:
  status: DEFAULT
  terse: recording time
  long: >-
    The 'Recording time' frame contains a timestamp describing when the
    audio was recorded.

TDRL:
  status: DEFAULT
  terse: release time
  long: >-
    The 'Release time' frame contains a timestamp describing when the
    audio was first released.

TDTG:
  status: DEFAULT
  terse: tagging time
  long: >-
    The 'Tagging time' frame contains a timestamp describing then the
    audio was tagged.

TENC:
  status: DEFAULT
  terse: encoded by
  long: >-
    The 'Encoded by' frame contains the name of the person or
    organisation that encoded the audio file. This field may contain a
    copyright message, if the audio file also is copyrighted by the
    encoder.

TEXT:
  status: DEFAULT
  terse: lyricist / text writer
  long: >-
    The 'Lyricist/Text writer' frame is intended for the writer of the
    text or lyrics in the recording.

TFLT:
  status: DEFAULT
  terse: file type
  long: |-
    The 'File type' frame indicates which type of audio this tag defines.
    The following types and refinements are defined:
      MIME   MIME type follows
      MPG    MPEG Audio
        /1     MPEG 1/2 layer I
        /2     MPEG 1/2 layer II
        /3     MPEG 1/2 layer III
        /2.5   MPEG 2.5
        /AAC   Advanced audio compression
      VQF    Transform-domain Weighted Interleave Vector Quantisation
      PCM    Pulse Code Modulated audio
    but other types may be used, but not for these types though. This is
    used in a similar way to the predefined types in the "TMED" frame,
    but without parentheses. If this frame is not present audio type is
    assumed to be "MPG".

TIPL:
  status: DEFAULT
  terse: involved people list
  long: >-
     The 'involved people list' is intended as a mapping between
     functions, like 'producer' and the person who filled that role on
     the recording. Every odd field is a role and every even row is an
     artist or a comma delimited list of artists.

TIT1:
  status: DEFAULT
  terse: content group description
  long: >-
    The 'Content group description' frame is used if the sound belongs to
    a larger category of sounds/music. For example, classical music is
    often sorted in different musical sections (e.g. "Piano Concerto",
    "Weather - Hurricane").

TIT2:
  status: DEFAULT
  terse: title / songname / content description
  long: >-
    The 'Title/Songname/Content description' frame is the actual name of
    the piece (e.g. "Adagio", "Hurricane Donna").

TIT3:
  status: DEFAULT
  terse: subtitle / description refinement
  long: >-
    The 'Subtitle/Description refinement' frame is used for information
    directly related to the contents title (e.g. "Op. 16" or "Performed
    live at Wembley").

TKEY:
  status: DEFAULT
  terse: initial key
  long: >-
    The 'Initial key' frame contains the musical key in which the sound
    starts. It is represented as a string with a maximum length of three
    characters. The ground keys are represented with "A","B","C","D","E",
    "F" and "G" and halfkeys represented with "b" and "#". Minor is
    represented as "m", e.g. "Dbm". Off key is represented with an
    "o" only.

TLAN:
  status: DEFAULT
  terse: language(s)
  long: >-
    The 'Language' frame should contain the languages of the text or
