I think this is a handbuilt portmanteau release, because two of the tracks on
it are older material originally released on the late, great Twitch remix
compilations from San Francisco's legendary underground remix service.

As best I can figure it out from what's on the release, my Twitch CDs, and the
Discogs listing for the promo of the album, the actual tracklisting of what
you've got is:

1. Ab Origine
2. The Reality of Nature [original mix]
3. Energy & Information / Beyond
4. Emergence
5. Telos
6. ??? Sunrise (I've heard this somewhere before, but a VERY long time ago, and I'm not sure this is the right name)
7. Pangaea / Come Closer / Nonwhere
8. The Reality of Nature [Jim Hopkins Twitch remix]

and it should be resequenced to

1. Ab Origine
2. Emergence
3. Pangaea / Come Closer / Nonwhere
4. Energy & Information / Beyond
5. Telos
6. ??? (Sunrise)
7. The Reality of Nature [original mix]
8. The Reality of Nature [Jim Hopkins Twitch mix]

The dropouts and glitches are kind of a bummer, but they sound like they were
part of the original burn, and also it's a real pain in the ass to rip from
CD-Rs. Thanks again for uploading this! I hope the corrected track listing is
useful!
